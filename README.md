## **Set Up the Project**

### **Automatic Setup (Using Scripts)**

1. **Run the Setup Script**:
   The project includes a setup script to automatically install dependencies and activate the virtual environment.

   - **For Windows**:
     Run the `setup.bat` script:
     ```bash
     setup.bat
     ```

   - **For macOS/Linux**:
     Run the `setup.sh` script:
     ```bash
     chmod +x setup.sh
     ./setup.sh
     ```

   This script will:
   - Create a virtual environment.
   - Install all dependencies listed in `requirements.txt`.
   - Activate the virtual environment.

2. **Verify the Setup**:
   After the script runs, ensure the virtual environment is activated. You should see `(venv)` in your terminal prompt.

---

### **Manual Setup**

1. **Create a Virtual Environment**:
   Run the following command to create a virtual environment:

   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   ```

2. **Activate the Virtual Environment**:
   - **For Windows**:
     ```bash
     venv\Scripts\activate
     ```
   - **For macOS/Linux**:
     ```bash
     source venv/bin/activate
     ```

3. **Install Dependencies**:
   Install the required dependencies using `pip`:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. **Set Up the Database**:
   Run the following commands to apply migrations and set up the database:
   ```bash
   python manage.py migrate
   ```

---

## **Run the Application**

1. **Start the Development Server**:
   Run the following command to start the Django development server:
   ```bash
   python manage.py runserver
   ```

2. **Access the Application**:
   Open your browser and navigate to:
   ```
   http://127.0.0.1:8000/
   ```

3. **Create a Superuser (Optional)**:
   To access the Django admin panel, create a superuser:
   ```bash
   python manage.py createsuperuser
   ```
   Then, log in at:
   ```
   http://127.0.0.1:8000/admin/
   ```

---

## **Edit the Application**

1. **Open the Project in Your Code Editor**:
   Use your preferred code editor (e.g., VS Code, PyCharm) to open the project directory.

2. **Make Changes**:
   - Edit the `views.py`, `models.py`, and `templates` files to customize the application.
   - Add new features or modify existing ones.

3. **Test Your Changes**:
   After making changes, restart the development server and test the application in your browser.

- **`api-gateway/`**: Contains the API Gateway microservice.
- **`course-service/`**: Contains the Course microservice.
- **`user-service/`**: Contains the User microservice.
- **`venv/`**: Virtual environment directory (created during setup).
- **`manage.py`**: Django management script.
- **`requirements.txt`**: Lists all project dependencies.
- **`setup.bat`**: Windows setup script.
- **`setup.sh`**: macOS/Linux setup script.
- **`README.md`**: This file.

## **Troubleshooting**

1. **Virtual Environment Not Activating**:
   - Ensure you are running the activation command from the correct directory.
   - If the issue persists, delete the `venv` folder and recreate it.

2. **Dependencies Not Installing**:
   - Ensure `pip` is up to date:
     ```bash
     python -m pip install --upgrade pip
     ```
   - Check your internet connection.

3. **Database Errors**:
   - Ensure you have applied all migrations:
     ```bash
     python manage.py migrate
     ```

4. **Port Already in Use**:
   - If port `8000` is already in use, specify a different port:
     ```bash
     python manage.py runserver 8001
     ```
